[H2Pack](https://github.com/scalable-matrix/H2Pack) is a library that provides linear-scaling storage and linear-scaling matrix-vector multiplication for dense kernel matrices. It can be used for Gaussian processes, solving integral equations, Brownian dynamics, and other applications. Please visit the H2Pack GitHub repository for more information.
