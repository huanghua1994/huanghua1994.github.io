I am an engineer working at NVIDIA.

Before joining NVIDIA, I received my:

* Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu), advised by [Prof. Edmond Chow](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~echow/), with dissertation "[New Parallel Algorithms for Large-Scale Matrix Computations](https://huanghua1994.github.io/files/GaTech-PhD-dissertation-2024.pdf)";
* M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Edmond Chow](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~echow/), with thesis "[Performance Optimizations for Quantum Chemistry Calculations](https://huanghua1994.github.io/files/GaTech-MS-thesis-2019.pdf)";
* B.S. in Information and Computing Science from [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), advised by Dr. Weicai Ye.

In 2023, I received the [2023 ACM-IEEE CS George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowship Honorable Mention](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2023/october/george-michael-fellowship-recipients-2023).

I have interned at the following companies:

* [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/), supervised by [Dr. Xing Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ewRsKt4AAAAJ&hl=en);
* [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), supervised by [Dr. Jeff Hammond](https://jeffhammond.github.io/).

My research interests include:

* High-performance computing and parallel computing;
* Numerical linear algebra algorithms;
* Computational chemistry;
* Efficient algorithms for data science.

I am always looking for new collaborators. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to hear more about my work or start a new collaboration! The best way to contact me is via email: huangh1994 at outlook.com.
