I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Edmond Chow](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~echow/). My proposed Ph.D. dissertation title is "New Parallel Algorithms for Large-Scale Matrix Computations".

During my Ph.D., I was lucky to spend time at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) with [Dr. Xing Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ewRsKt4AAAAJ&hl=en), and at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) with [Dr. Jeff Hammond](https://jeffhammond.github.io/). In my final year, I received the [2023 ACM-IEEE CS George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowship Honorable Mention](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2023/october/george-michael-fellowship-recipients-2023).

I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Edmond Chow](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~echow/). My M.S. thesis title was "[Performance Optimization for Quantum Chemistry Calculations](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/62691)".

I received my B.S. in Information and Computing Science from [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Weicai Ye.

My research interests include:

* High-performance computing  and parallel computing;
* Matrix computation;
* Computational chemistry;
* Performance engineering.

I am always looking for new collaborators. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you would like to hear more about my work or start a new collaboration! The best way to contact me is via email: huangh223 at gatech.edu / huangh1994 at outlook.com.
